# Stellar Stars
A mod for Starbound intended to redesign the visual appearance of stars by giving them a retro appearance! Be advised that some star-related assets, such as those visible in the cockpit, remain unmodified because of technical limitations related to image rescaling.

Stellar Stars is a part of the greater Stellarscape project, and it will be treated as a companion mod once Stellarscape is released.

# Installation
Extract the contents of the most recent .zip file from the releases page to Starbound's /mods directory. Ensure that a folder named "Stellar Stars" exists in-between the contents of the mod and the starbound/mods folder. More information can be found at [starbounder.org](https://starbounder.org/Mods/Installation).

Stellar Stars will be made available on the Steam Workshop once there is support for Frackin' Universe. Until then, please refrain from redistributing the mod. People will be upset that it lacks support for Frackin' Universe if you do. Trust me.
